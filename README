--------------

kdllar is an enhanced version of dllar.cmd.

kdllar supports all options of dllar.cmd.

kdllar has better things than dllar.cmd like this,

    - Accept a response file
    - Process a very long command line
    - Do not depend on CMD.EXE and kRx.exe

History
-------

v1.1.0 ( 2016/01/30 )
    - Create an import lib from a DLL directly
        * Support symbols declared by __declspec(dllexport) but not specified
        in .def file

    - Mimic a bug of dllar
        * For example, -libd "DATA MULTIPLE", which is used in gcc project, is
        allowed even if it's an error because it will be "DATA DATA MULTIPLE"
        in .def file.

    - Supress 'xxx has already been exported' warning of WLINK
    - Allow to use of -symfile and -in[clude]/-ex[clude]/-ord[inals] together
        * -symfile adds symbols of symbol files to -in[clude] list
        * Support of ordinals in symbol files are dropped. If needed, use .def
        file
        * Even if symbols in symbol files do not exist in a DLL, it does not
        cause an error, but it is ignored silently like -in[clude]

v1.0.0( 2014/10/22 )
    - Different things from dllar.cmd
        * Default of -libf[lags] is INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE
        * Default of -libd[ata] is MULTIPLE NONSHARED
        * -omf puts -Zomf flag at the start of GCC command line
        * -omf is always used
        * A static library name is not changed
        * An import library name has _dll suffix

    - New things
        * -in[clude] : include specified symbols
        * -nokeepdef : remove a generated def file after finish
        * -implib    : specify an customized import library name
                       independent a DLL name
        * -symfile   : specify a file containing symbols to be exported
        * -symprefix : prepend an underline to each symbols in a file
                       specified by -symfile
        * -objext    : specify additional object extensions
